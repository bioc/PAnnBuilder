\title{Map Protein Identifiers to Gene Symbols}
\description{
  #PKGNAME#SYMBOL is an R environment that provides mappings between
  protein identifiers and gene abbreviations. 
}
\details{
  Each protein identifier is mapped to an abbreviation for the
  corresponding gene. An \code{NA} is reported if there is no known
  abbreviation for a given gene.
  
  Symbols typically consist of 3 letters that define either a single
  gene (ABC) or multiple genes (ABC1, ABC2, ABC3). Gene symbols can be
  used as key words to query public databases such as Entrez Gene.
  
  Mappings were based on data provided by:
